    1. The user will enter the following info:
    2. Total starting asset amount to be sold.
    3. The percentage of the total asset to be sold at each price level
    4. How much the price will be incremented by (I.E: $1 increase between prices, $0.50, $2 etc...)
    5. The price to start selling at
    6. The price to stop selling at

The calculations will be displayed below the input form and dynamically added to the screen as more calculations are ran.
